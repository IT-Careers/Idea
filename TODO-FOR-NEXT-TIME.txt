LAST TIME: Implemented all 8 octants location generation. Implemented travel to location.

NEXT TIME: Research if location generation is done correctly. There is doubts that checks are correct...
Too many generated locations from previous time. Probably generate celestial bodies inside of location.

TODO (maybe next time): Probably host this somewhere (heroku?).
TODO (maybe next time): Also we need to generate Locations for Celestial bodies inside main location.
