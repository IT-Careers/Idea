LAST TIME: Generation of locations reworked. New generation uses 8 octants to always generate locations away from zero zero zero.

NEXT TIME: We implemented only 2 octancts, so we have to implement other 6.

TODO (maybe next time): Travelling to specific locations.
TODO (maybe next time): Probably host this somewhere (heroku?).
TODO (maybe next time): Also we need to generate Locations for Celestial bodies inside main location.
